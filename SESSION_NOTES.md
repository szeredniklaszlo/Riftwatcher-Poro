# Session Notes (2026-02-19)

## Service Snapshot

- Branch: `main`
- Runtime model: single Discord worker process (`python -m src.app`)
- Tracked player persistence: Postgres (`tracked_players`)
- Scoreboard model: one persisted message in `DAILY_REPORT_CHANNEL_ID`

## What Is Running

- Refresh worker: periodic full daily stats refresh + scoreboard sync + cache cleanup
- Rank worker: rank up/down detection against `player_ranked_state`
- Recap worker: new match recap posts + affected-player stats resync
- Backfill worker: low-priority older match DB cache backfill

All workers include startup jitter and per-cycle heartbeat logs:

- `Startup jitter sleep=...s`
- `Cycle complete elapsed=...ms next_sleep=...s`

## Current Defaults Worth Remembering

- `MAX_TODAY_MATCH_DETAILS=100`
- `MAX_MATCH_IDS_SCAN=2000`
- `MAX_IN_MEMORY_MATCH_CACHE=200`
- `MATCH_CACHE_RETENTION_DAYS=730`
- `DAILY_REFRESH_SECONDS=300`
- `MATCH_RECAP_POLL_SECONDS=90`
- `REPORT_CACHE_SECONDS=120`
- `REPORT_DAY_START_HOUR=6`

## Important Behavior Notes

- Rank alerts are only for ranked -> ranked level changes.
- Unranked -> ranked first observations are baseline only (no alert).
- Rank up message uses celebration copy.
- Rank down message uses flame copy with poop emoji.
- Backfill fetches use `cache_in_memory=False` so historical backfill does not fill in-memory cache.
- Snapshot update pushes are throttled to reduce Discord edit spam.

## Known Operational Characteristics

- High `MAX_TODAY_MATCH_DETAILS` increases refresh cycle time significantly for heavy accounts.
- Occasional Riot `429` is expected; retries/backoff are built in.
- `RANK_ALERT_CHANNEL_ID` in startup logs is an alias label for `EVENTS_CHANNEL_ID`.
- If recap/events share the same channel ID, message bursts can appear clustered.

## Quick Resume Checklist

1. Pull latest `main`.
2. Verify required env vars:
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN`
   - `RIOT_API_KEY`
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `DAILY_REPORT_CHANNEL_ID`
   - `MATCH_RECAP_CHANNEL_ID`
   - `EVENTS_CHANNEL_ID`
3. Start bot and confirm startup logs show all worker jitter lines.
4. Run smoke checks in Discord:
   - `!health`
   - `!Mood`
5. Verify heartbeat logs continue:
   - `refresh`, `rank`, `recap`, `backfill`

## Next Improvement Candidates

- Add log sampling/structured metrics export for cycle latency trends.

## Scoring V2 Draft (Recovered)

Historical draft recovered from earlier README notes (`d8d0edc`):

- Add Bayesian smoothing for win rate to reduce low-game volatility.
  - Example: `p_bayes = (wins + a) / (games + a + b)`, with `a=b=3`.
- Keep an uncertainty penalty, but smoother for small samples.
  - Example: `conf = sqrt(games / (games + k))`, with `k=8`.
- Add role-aware performance component using tracked metrics:
  - CS/min, player damage, objective damage, vision, deaths.
  - Normalize by role/day baselines to reduce role bias.
- Add recency weighting so recent games matter more.
- Candidate composite:
  - `GamerScore = 100 * (0.65 * p_bayes * conf + 0.25 * perf_norm + 0.10 * recency_norm)`

## Future Fun Features Backlog

- Daily MVP + "Clutch/Int" awards:
  - Auto-post superlatives from stats (best CS/min, biggest damage, most deaths, etc.).
- Head-to-head leaderboard:
  - `!vs Name1 Name2` for today/week with win rate and KDA comparison.
- ~~Streak callouts~~ ✅ Implemented (2026-02-24)
- Weekly title belts:
  - Rotating titles like "Damage King", "Objective Goblin", and "Vision Dad".
- Prediction game:
  - Players predict someone’s day record and earn points for close calls.
- Personal profile cards:
  - `!profile Name#Tag` with trend view, best queue, and signature champion/role.
- Party synergy stat:
  - Rank duo/trio combinations among tracked players by win rate.
- Seasonal points system:
  - Month-long points race with winner announcement and crown.
- Clip/quote of the day:
  - Attach one player-submitted quote or clip to recap flow.
- Boss challenge mode:
  - Weekly team objective with success/fail announcement.

## Resume Snapshot (2026-02-20)

- Branch: `main`
- Working tree: clean
- Latest pushed commits:
  - `e8081ba` `feat(recap): batch close recaps and pace split posts`
  - `28e6f2a` `docs(backlog): add unimplemented feature and improvement tracker`
  - `f0cff5f` `docs(session): restore recovered scoring v2 draft notes`
  - `b41f537` `chore(config): require weekly report channel id`
  - `dd6d560` `fix(weekly): use monday cutoff-to-cutoff window`
  - `4575a8f` `feat(weekly): add monday-friday report in dedicated channel`
  - `5836fe4` `fix(remake): exclude remakes from scoring and recap notifications`
  - `696f277` `feat(recap): include match duration in recap header`

### Implemented This Session

- Weekly report system:
  - New command: `!Week`
  - Dedicated channel: `WEEKLY_REPORT_CHANNEL_ID` (now required)
  - Weekly window now uses cutoff semantics:
    - Monday `REPORT_DAY_START_HOUR` -> next Monday `REPORT_DAY_START_HOUR` (exclusive)
  - Weekly scoreboard persists message id and is auto-refreshed from DB aggregates.
- Remakes are excluded from:
  - recap notifications
  - ranked streak logic
  - daily/weekly scoring rollups
- Recap UX improvements:
  - Header includes match duration (`MM:SS`)
  - Blank line between player sections
  - Multiple close matches in one cycle are batched into one recap post (with separators)
  - If batch must be split for Discord length, split posts are paced with a short delay.
- Added `IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG.md` to track unimplemented suggestions/features.

### Current Test Status

- Full suite currently passes:
  - `& 'C:\Users\gardf\AppData\Local\Python\bin\python.exe' -m pytest -q`
  - Result: `52 passed`

### Current Operational Notes

- Priority workers (`refresh`, `recap`, `rank`) remain high-priority.
- Backfill is intentionally de-prioritized under rate-limit pressure.
- Riot `429` can still occur during peak load, but backfill now yields and global limiter smooths burst pressure.
- If logs show many Riot `401` responses across refresh/rank/recap workers, `RIOT_API_KEY` is expired/invalid and must be rotated.

### Updated Resume Checklist

1. Pull latest `main`.
2. Verify required env vars:
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN`
   - `RIOT_API_KEY`
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `DAILY_REPORT_CHANNEL_ID`
   - `WEEKLY_REPORT_CHANNEL_ID`
   - `MATCH_RECAP_CHANNEL_ID`
   - `EVENTS_CHANNEL_ID`
3. Start bot and confirm startup logs include all worker jitter lines and weekly channel id.
4. Discord smoke checks:
   - `!health`
   - `!Mood`
   - `!Week`
   - `!riottest`
5. If recap feed feels slow/noisy:
   - tune `MATCH_RECAP_POLL_SECONDS` (effective floor is 30s)
   - recap batching/split pacing is now built-in.

## Resume Snapshot (2026-02-22)

- Branch: `main`
- Working tree at end of session: clean expected after pull
- Latest pushed commit:
  - `4ac1fe8` `feat(recap): merge streak callouts into recap batch posts`

### Implemented This Session

- Recap + streak post consolidation:
  - Streak callouts are now appended into the recap batch output when they occur in the same recap cycle.
  - Result: fewer back-to-back Discord posts in recap/event-heavy moments.
  - Files:
    - `src/discord_recap_worker.py`
    - `tests/test_discord_recap_worker.py`

### Validation

- Recap worker tests:
  - `& 'C:\Users\gardf\AppData\Local\Python\bin\python.exe' -m pytest -q tests/test_discord_recap_worker.py`
  - Result: `6 passed`
- Full suite:
  - `& 'C:\Users\gardf\AppData\Local\Python\bin\python.exe' -m pytest -q`
  - Result: `60 passed`

### Ops/DB Checks Performed

- Connected to Railway Postgres with `psql`.
- Verified `bot_state` and `player_ranked_state` freshness:
  - active backfill offsets updating
  - `last_seen_match_id::*` keys current
  - recap/streak state keys present and updating
  - daily/weekly report message pointers present
  - rank baseline rows updated recently
- One Riot ID displays garbled in Windows console output (code page issue), but state keys are internally consistent.

### Important Follow-up

- Rotate Railway Postgres password immediately (password was exposed in terminal/chat during setup).
- Optional: add `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\bin` to PATH for direct `psql` usage.

### Quick Re-entry Steps

1. Pull latest `main`.
2. Rotate DB password and update `DATABASE_URL` where configured.
3. Redeploy/restart worker if environment was changed.
4. Run smoke checks in Discord:
   - `!health`
   - `!Mood`
   - `!Week`
5. Verify recap behavior:
   - confirm recap + streak appear in one combined recap batch message.

## Resume Snapshot (2026-02-24)

- Branch: `main`
- Working tree: clean
- Latest pushed commits:
  - `106433f` `docs: update README and ARCHITECTURE for streak tiers and !streak command`
  - `1715a8a` `fix(commands): route !streak to match recap channel`
  - `36349d1` `feat(commands): add !streak Name#Tag command`
  - `5e20de4` `fix(recap): add ! to end of legendary streak message`
  - `e03f073` `feat(recap): add legendary tier for 8+ game win/loss streaks`
  - `4da4aa1` `fix(recap): increase streak lookback from 8 to 20 matches`

### Implemented This Session

- Fixed streak callout suppression for long streaks:
  - `get_ranked_streak_info` lookback was capped at 8 matches; streaks beyond 8 produced the same dedup token and were silently dropped.
  - Raised `max_matches` from 8 → 20 (matches the already-fetched `count=20` recent IDs).
- Added third streak callout tier (8+ games):
  - Win 8+: 👑 **LEGENDARY** "This is not a drill. Someone call Riot!"
  - Loss 8+: 🛑 **FULL TILT** "Log off. Touch grass. This is a cry for help."
  - Existing tiers unchanged: Momentum (3–4), Heater Alert / Cold Streak (5–7), Tilt Watch (5–7).
- Added `!streak Name#Tag` command (recap channel):
  - Fetches 20 recent matches, computes current ranked streak, posts the appropriate callout tier.
  - Updates the dedup token so the worker won't re-fire the same count automatically.
  - Works for any valid Riot ID (not limited to tracked players).
  - Files: `src/constants.py`, `src/discord_command_handlers.py`, `src/discord_bot.py`, `tests/test_discord_command_handlers.py`

### Validation

- Full suite: `64 passed`

### Quick Re-entry Steps

1. Pull latest `main`.
2. Run smoke checks:
   - `!health` (events channel)
   - `!streak Name#Tag` (recap channel)
3. Verify streak tiers fire correctly on next win/loss past 8.
