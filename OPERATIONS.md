# Riftwatcher Poro Operations Runbook

## Riot 401 Recovery

Symptom:
- Logs include `Riot API returned 401 Unauthorized`.
- Bot can no longer fetch Riot data.

Actions:
1. Update `RIOT_API_KEY` in Railway project variables.
2. Redeploy the service.
3. Run `!riottest` in `EVENTS_CHANNEL_ID`.
4. Confirm `!health` shows DB/workers healthy and recap/report activity resumes.

Notes:
- The 401 alert is deduped in `bot_state` (`riot_401_alert_sent`) to avoid spam.
- If needed for a fresh alert cycle, clear that state key manually in DB.

## Streak TTS Behavior

Command:
- `!tts on|off|status`

Allowed channels:
- `EVENTS_CHANNEL_ID`
- `MATCH_RECAP_CHANNEL_ID`

Scope:
- Controls TTS only for streak callout messages.
- Applies to:
  - automatic streak callouts from recap worker
  - manual `!streak Name#Tag` callouts
- Does not affect recap messages themselves.

## Historical Stats Backfill

Command:
- `!backfill YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD`

Allowed channel:
- `EVENTS_CHANNEL_ID`

Behavior:
- Rebuilds `player_daily_stats` rows from cached match payloads (`match_info_cache`) only.
- Does not call Riot APIs.
- Recomputes expanded stat fields (assists/gold/wards/objective takedowns/multi-kills/KP numerators+denominators).
- Maximum range is 366 days per command run.

Troubleshooting:
1. If output shows high `Tracked players missing PUUID`, verify `tracked_players.puuid` is populated.
2. If output shows low matches scanned, check cache retention settings and recent cache cleanup activity.
3. If no rows updated, confirm requested date range overlaps cached match end times in the report timezone/day-start window.

## Recap vs Streak Message Separation

Expected behavior:
- Match recap messages and streak callouts are posted as separate Discord messages.
- Recap messages are always non-TTS.
- Streak callouts use TTS based on `!tts` state.

If behavior looks merged:
1. Verify bot version is current deployment.
2. Check for custom/manual posting logic outside MoodBot.
3. Run tests: `python -m pytest -q tests/test_discord_recap_worker.py`.

## Arena Recap Troubleshooting

Expected behavior:
- Queue `1750` posts as `Arena 3x6`.
- Arena player lines use placement/team instead of lane role.
- Augments and items are shown by name when static data can be loaded; raw IDs are used as fallback.
- Skillshots hit/dodged are shown when Riot includes those challenge stats.

If a recent Arena match does not appear:
1. Check recap worker logs for `No new matches to post`.
   - `initialized_players > 0` means the worker established a baseline and will only post future matches.
   - `players_with_new_ids=0` means Riot's recent match list did not contain a newer match than the stored recap key.
2. Check `Match scan summary`.
   - `candidate_matches > 0` and `prepared_matches=0` means matches were fetched but skipped.
   - `skipped_remakes` indicates remake/short-duration filtering.
   - `skipped_no_tracked` indicates the fetched match did not include tracked participants.
3. If the daily refresh sees `matches=1 total=0W-0L solo=0W-0L flex=0W-0L`, that can be normal for Arena because daily scoreboard totals only include solo/flex ranked queues.
4. If augment/item names are missing, verify outbound access to CommunityDragon/Data Dragon from the host. The recap still works with raw IDs when static data is unavailable.

## Daily Scoreboard Duplicate Message Guard

Symptom:
- A new daily leaderboard message appears instead of updating the tracked one.

Current behavior:
- Transient Discord API fetch failures (`discord.HTTPException`) no longer clear tracked message IDs.
- Tracked message state is cleared only when Discord returns `NotFound` or `Forbidden`.

Troubleshooting:
1. Confirm deployment includes commit `39b522c` or later.
2. Check logs for `NotFound`/`Forbidden` while fetching tracked daily/weekly messages.
3. Verify bot permissions in `DAILY_REPORT_CHANNEL_ID` still allow reading message history and editing messages.
4. If IDs were previously reset due to old behavior, run `!Daily` once to re-anchor tracked message IDs.

## GitLab Deploy Rules

Current pipeline behavior:
- `test` job runs on pushes and merge requests.
- `deploy_to_railway` runs when:
  - `FORCE_DEPLOY == "1"`, or
  - commit is on default branch and changed files include:
    - `src/**/*`
    - `requirements.txt`
    - `Procfile`
    - `railway.json`
    - `.gitlab-ci.yml`

Implication:
- Test-only commits normally do not deploy.

## Health Triage Checklist (`!health`)

Check in this order:
1. `DB: ok`
2. Workers line (`refresh`, `rank`, `recap`, `backfill`) shows cycles increasing and low errors.
3. `Backfill cursors active` and `Backfill max offset` are not growing unexpectedly for long periods.
4. `Match cache entries` and `Report cache active` are sensible for current activity.
5. Baselines line is present once score baselines are built.

Fast diagnosis patterns:
- `DB: down`: investigate DB connectivity/credentials first.
- Worker errors rising with no cycle growth: inspect logs for failing external API/channel access.
- Recap issues with healthy DB: verify `MATCH_RECAP_CHANNEL_ID` permissions and Riot API health.

## Local Testing & Smoke Checks

For developers running a local instance for testing:

1. **Environment**: Ensure all required variables from `README.md` are in your `.env`.
2. **Verify Tests**: `python -m pytest -q` (requires no active bot or DB).
3. **Smoke Test Command List**:
   - `!health` (Check DB and worker cycles)
   - `!Daily` (Trigger scoreboard update)
   - `!Weekly` (Trigger weekly update)
   - `!tts status` (Verify TTS configuration)
   - `!streak Name#Tag` (Test streak routing)
   - `!profile Name#Tag` (Test player data fetch)
   - `!riottest` (Verify Riot API key and outbound connectivity)
