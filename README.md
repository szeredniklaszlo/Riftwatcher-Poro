Riftwatcher Poro is a Discord bot for tracking ranked League of Legends performance for a list of tracked Riot IDs.
It maintains daily and weekly scoreboard messages, posts match recaps, and posts rank up/down alerts.

## Runtime Entry

- Run locally: `python -m src.app`
- Railway/Procfile worker: `python -m src.app`

## Self-Hosting

Riftwatcher Poro is intended to be self-hosted as one bot instance per Discord server/community. Each deployment uses its own Discord bot token, Riot API key, Postgres database, channel IDs, and tracked player list.

Start with:

- `.env.example` - copyable environment variable template.
- `SELF_HOSTING.md` - Discord/Riot/Postgres/Railway setup guide.

## Project Structure

- `src/app.py` - process entrypoint

- `src/discord_backfill_worker.py` - low-priority historical cache backfill
- `src/runtime/` - shared runtime worker/message/alert helpers
- `src/db/` - Postgres pool, schema, and persistence helpers
- `src/report_logic.py` - pure ranking/window helpers
- `src/rank_logic.py` - rank queue normalization and rank-change message formatting
- `tests/` - unit tests

## Features

- `!Daily` keeps two tracked messages in `DAILY_REPORT_CHANNEL_ID`:
  - top message: previous day snapshot
  - second message: current day live scoreboard
- At daily rollover (`REPORT_DAY_START_HOUR` in `REPORT_TIMEZONE`), previous day message is replaced with the last completed daily report and its header includes the cycle date.
- `!Weekly` keeps a single weekly scoreboard message updated in `WEEKLY_REPORT_CHANNEL_ID`.
- Daily window starts at `REPORT_DAY_START_HOUR` in `REPORT_TIMEZONE`.
- Weekly window aggregates existing daily stats from Monday at `REPORT_DAY_START_HOUR` through next Monday at the same hour in `REPORT_TIMEZONE`.
- Ranked queues tracked in report:
  - Solo/Duo (`420`)
  - Flex (`440`)
- Scoreboard rank ordering uses Wilson lower bound (displayed as `Gamer Score`).
- Match recap posts in `MATCH_RECAP_CHANNEL_ID` with:
  - queue + end time + match duration
  - champion/role for ranked Summoner's Rift queues
  - W/L, K/D/A, CS/min
  - player/objective damage, damage taken, healing, vision
  - Arena (`1750`) placement/team formatting
  - Arena augments and items by name when static data is available
  - Arena skillshots hit/dodged from match challenge stats
- Win/loss streak callouts post in `MATCH_RECAP_CHANNEL_ID` as separate messages:
  - 3-4 wins: Momentum
  - 5-7 wins: Heater Alert
  - 8+ wins: LEGENDARY
  - 3-4 losses: Cold Streak
  - 5-7 losses: Tilt Watch
  - 8+ losses: FULL TILT
  - TTS is enabled by default and can be toggled with `!tts on|off|status`
- Rank alerts post in `EVENTS_CHANNEL_ID`:
  - rank up: congratulatory message
  - rank down: flame message
  - first-seen unranked -> ranked transitions are baseline only (no alert)
- Daily performance badges are computed from ranked matches only.
- Expanded daily stats now track:
  - assists, gold earned, wards placed/killed
  - turret/dragon/baron takedowns
  - double/triple/quadra/penta kills
  - kill participation numerator/denominator

## Background Workers

All workers start with jitter to avoid bursty startup traffic and log cycle heartbeat timing.

- Refresh worker (`DAILY_REFRESH_SECONDS`, default `300`)
  - rebuilds daily stats
  - updates the current-day scoreboard snapshot with throttling
  - ensures daily two-message layout exists and handles day rollover copy (today -> previous day)
  - runs DB match-cache cleanup (`MATCH_CACHE_RETENTION_DAYS`)
- Rank worker (`max(30, DAILY_REFRESH_SECONDS)`)
  - compares current ranked entries vs persisted `player_ranked_state`
- Recap worker (`MATCH_RECAP_POLL_SECONDS`, default `90`)
  - detects newly finished matches and posts recaps
  - posts streak callouts as separate messages (not merged into recap batches)
  - refreshes affected players' daily stats and forces scoreboard sync
- Backfill worker (`max(120, DAILY_REFRESH_SECONDS * 2)`)
  - only when no new matches are detected
  - fetches a limited number of older matches into DB cache
  - uses `cache_in_memory=False` to avoid polluting in-memory cache

## Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `DAILY_REPORT_CHANNEL_ID`

- `RIOT_REGIONAL_ROUTING` (`europe`) - regional host for account/match-v5 API calls (`europe`, `americas`, `asia`)

## Data Tables

- `tracked_players` - tracked Riot IDs + optional PUUID
- `player_daily_stats` - per-day wins/losses + performance aggregates
- `match_info_cache` - cached match payload JSON
- `bot_state` - generic state keys (message ids, last seen ids, flags)
- `player_ranked_state` - last known rank state per player/queue

## Testing

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

On Windows, if `python` resolves to a WindowsApps alias, run tests with the Python launcher or an explicit interpreter path:

```powershell
py -3.11 -m pytest -q
```

## Operations Notes

- If `MAX_TODAY_MATCH_DETAILS` is high, refresh cycles can become long on heavy accounts.
- If Riot rate-limits (`429`), client retries with backoff.
- Warning when recap and daily channel IDs are equal is informational only.
- Daily/weekly tracked message IDs are now preserved across transient Discord API fetch failures (`HTTPException`) to avoid accidental duplicate scoreboard posts.
- `!backfill` rebuilds from `match_info_cache` only and does not call Riot APIs.
- See `OPERATIONS.md` for incident response, deploy rules, and health triage steps.

## Additional Documentation

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` for module/runtime structure.
- `OPERATIONS.md` for incident response and runbook steps.
- `IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG.md` for prioritized future work.
