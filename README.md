# MoodBot

MoodBot is a Discord bot that tracks your group's League of Legends performance for today and posts a clean mood board in Discord.

It pulls live data from Riot's APIs, calculates each player's daily record, ranks everyone by win rate, and keeps no-match players at the bottom.

## What It Does

- Connects to Discord and listens in one configured channel.
- Fetches player account and match data from Riot API.
- Builds a "today only" report:
  - Wins / losses
  - Win rate percentage
  - Mood emoji (green/yellow/red)
- Sorts players from best to worst win rate.
- Shows players with no matches today at the end.
- Responds to `!Mood` with:
  - A quick "working..." message
  - Then edits that message into the final formatted report
- Also posts a scheduled daily report at 20:00 local time.

## Commands

- `!Mood` - Generate and post today's ranked mood report.
- `!Add Name#Tag` - Add a new tracked player at runtime.
- `!test` - Simple Discord send test.
- `!riottest` - Basic Riot connectivity test.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- `discord.py`
- `requests`

## Run Locally

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
set DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token
set RIOT_API_KEY=your_riot_key
set DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
python Bot.py
```

## How The Report Is Calculated

1. Resolve each Riot ID (`gameName#tagLine`) to `puuid`.
2. Pull recent matches from Match-V5.
3. Keep only matches completed today (local date).
4. Count wins and losses for each player.
5. Compute win rate and sort descending.
6. Append no-match players at the bottom.

## Configuration

Required environment variables:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN`
- `RIOT_API_KEY`
- `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`

Optional environment variables:

- `RIOT_FRIENDS` (comma-separated Riot IDs, for example `PlayerOne#EUW,PlayerTwo#NA1`)
- `PLAYERS_FILE` (path to persisted tracked players file, default: `tracked_players.txt`)

## Player Persistence

- Runtime `!Add` updates are saved to `tracked_players.txt` (or `PLAYERS_FILE` path).
- If the file exists, startup loads players from it; otherwise startup uses `RIOT_FRIENDS`.
- `tracked_players.txt` is ignored by git.
- On Railway, filesystem storage is ephemeral across rebuilds/redeploys, so `!Add` entries may reset unless you move persistence to a database.

## Railway Deployment (GitLab CI)

This repository includes:

- `.gitlab-ci.yml` - deploy job for Railway on pushes to your default branch.
- `railway.json` - Railway start command and restart policy.
- `Procfile` - worker process declaration (`python Bot.py`).

Set these CI/CD variables in GitLab (`Settings -> CI/CD -> Variables`):

- `RAILWAY_TOKEN` (Railway token)
- `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID` (target Railway service ID) or `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID` (optional, deploy target environment)

Set these runtime variables in Railway service settings:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN`
- `RIOT_API_KEY`
- `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`
- `RIOT_FRIENDS` (optional)
